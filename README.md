***

The following benchmarks must be met in order to meet the client's expections of a fully functioning JavaScript quiz application.
1. **An accesible welcome page that explains the game's rules and parameters**
 - Page will also include a quiz timer in the top right corner of the screen, and link to view high scores in the top left.

2. **Once the user clicks on start button they are presented with a question, and the timer counts down from 60 seconds**

3. **When user answers a question, they are prsented with an instant result and new quiz question**

4. **Incorrect answers deduct 10 seconds from the user's session time**

5. **The game is over once all questions are answered, or the user runs out of time**
- User will then be directed to a submission page that will display their score and provide text area to enter initials.
- Clicking the submit button will take user to a high scores page where they can view their score, and the scores of peers.
- Two buttons will be present: One to Go back to the first page and replay, the other to clear all high scores.
- Clearing all high scores will clear local storage and remove display of all high scores.
